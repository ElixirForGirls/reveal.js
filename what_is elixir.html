          In the words of its creator, we can define as a dynamic, functional language designed for building
          scalable and maintainable applications.
          When we talk about Elixir as functional programming you shouldn't be worried maybe you are thinking Do I need
          to learn advanced mathematics? Do I need to forget about everything that I already know? Will be a huge
          difference comparing with other programming languages?
          To be honest, I would say at the beginning I was scared too but in real life, I've used elixir for production
          projects and notice that the answer is not you don't need actually you will use everything that you already
          know about programming plus a few things that we will learn in this workshop.

          <aside class="notes">
            Immutable means that you can never reassign or edit data structure.
            Instead, you’d have to return new values whenever a change has to happen in a data structure. This means
            that we will have full
            transparency in our code as the only things that matter in a function is the input and the
            output - making unit testing and debugging so much easier.
            In Elixir you can pattern match on almost everything, almost everywhere. If we take
            a look into Wikipedia's definition

            &ldquo;In computer science, pattern matching is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens
            for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the
            match usually has to be exact: "either it will or will not be a match."&rdquo;

            this is one of the most things that I like about Elixir. In a few minutes we will do a small demo to see how
            it works just keep in mind this fancy term is acceptable in an exact match or replica of the values that we
            are comparing so we have only tow ways YES/NOT

          <aside class="notes">
            For now, I don't want to dive deeper in the use the pipeline, just keep in mind this concept I think is
            better to explain in practice
            Also, elixir has a bunch of tools that make us life easier like

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            mix - A modern build tool
            iex - Elixir's interactive shell.
            hex - A package manager
            ExUnit - A test framework that runs your test suite
            As elixir is a language build in the top of erlang you have interoperability with the Erlang ecosystem

            And probably you are asking Erlang what is this? Don't be worried we are not going deep in this topic.
            A briefly summary erlang is also a functional programming language developed at Ericsson by Joe Armstrong,
            Robert Virding, and Mike Williams in 1986

            Some of them are active in the community like conferences or even meetups. Unfortunately, Joe passed away
            this
            year so It's was a huge loss for the community, he always was at the meetups inspiring people
            It makes me sad because I could meet him he remained as inspiration to learn more about programing in
            general.
            So yeah there is a wild world outside but we are here to help and the most important is that you found
            elixir as
            something that you love to work on or maybe you figure out that you don't like why not?

            <aside class="notes">
              Alright!
              Everyone open your terminal let's start typing iex, you will see the elixir interactive shell, which is a
              useful
              tool for exploring elixir
              for instance, let's say we want to sum to integers like 1 + 2, also elixir has floats for example lets divide
              7
              / 2.
    
              You also have useful functions, for example, the last operation that we did we can call div(7,2)
              if you need help or more information about using a function you can call helper function h(div)
    
              Ok
              What else we have? well we have Strings
    
              we have atoms, Atoms are constants that are used to name things. In a way, they are just like strings the
              difference is in the representation.
              we use colon like :my_first_atom
    
              Also, we have booleans true false
    
              Tuples are a collection of values like {x,y,z} usually they are small two or three values like {:ok,
              "created"}
              or {:error, "message"} tuples are used to pass flagged values
    
              We also have a list I would be cleary in this in elixir list are not arrays like in other languages yep it can
              be
              tricky but let me go back to the presentation
              I took borrow these images form Dave Thomas curse which by the way is one of the best online curses.
    
              Maps are a collection of key => value maybe you know this as dictionary or hashes
